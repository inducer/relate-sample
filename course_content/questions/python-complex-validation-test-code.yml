    if not isinstance(b, list):
        feedback.finish(0, "b should be a list.")

    if not len(b) == 50:

    if not len(set(b)) == 1:
        feedback.finish(0, "The elements in b should be the same.")

    if not b[0] == a:
        feedback.finish(0.3, "The elements in b have wrong values.")

    feedback.finish(1, "b looks good.")

    b = [a] * 50

rubric: |

    The code has to be squeaky-clean.

    # Create a list containing 50 a.
    b = ...
