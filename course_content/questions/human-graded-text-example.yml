    # Submit an exam question

    Submit your practice exam question in the box below.

    {% from "content-macros.jinja" import collapsible %}
    {% call collapsible("Instructions", id="instr") %}

    Use this pattern as a starting point:
    ```
    type: ChoiceQuestion
    id: myquestion
    shuffle: True
    prompt: |

        # What is your favorite number?

        There are many beautiful numbers. What's your
        favorite one?

    choices:

      - "1"
      - "2"
      - ~CORRECT~ 15
      - ~CORRECT~ $\pi$
      - $\sqrt 2$
    ```

    A few comments on how the questions are written:

    * You just need to change the `prompt` and the `choices`.
      Leave everything else as it is.
    * If you like, you can assign an `id`. This field must be all
      lower-case alphanumeric, no spaces. Underscores `_` are allowed.
    * Bare numbers as answer choices must be enclosed in quotes.
    * Mark the correct answer with a `~CORRECT~` tag.
    * Everything is formatted using [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).
      You may use LaTeX math, enclosed in `$...$` for in-line math and
      `$$...$$` for display math.
    * Make sure to keep the indentation in place, otherwise the question
      won't be accepted by RELATE.
    * If you'd like to see what your question will look like, you can play with it
      [here](../../../sandbox/page/).

    You will receive the extra credit for your submitted question if we
    determine that you have done an 'honest job' trying to create a
    good exam question--basically if we can tell that you've put some
    work into your question.  For example, just copying and pasting a
    quiz question and changing the numbers slightly does not count. You
    can look for inspiration in the quizzes, though. Other sources of
    inspiration include the notes, the textbook and the
    demos--basically any fact that we've learned can be turned into a
    good question. Try to avoid True/False questions--those are very
    easy to guess and therefore not often good. Try to come up with
    good, confusing, plausible-sounding (but wrong) alternatives.

    {% endcall %}

    Please try to emphasize the part of the class that will be on the
    second midterm--that is to say, everything from orthogonality onward.
