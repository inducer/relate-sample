    # Adding two numbers in Python

    Your code will receive two variables, *a* and *b*. Compute their sum and
    assign it to *c*.

setup_code: |
    import random

    a = random.uniform(-10, 10)
    b = random.uniform(-10, 10)

names_for_user: [a, b]

correct_code: |

    c = a + b

names_from_user: [c]

test_code: |
    if not isinstance(c, float):
        feedback.finish(0, "Your computed c is not a float.")

    correct_c = a + b
    rel_err = abs(correct_c-c)/abs(correct_c)

    if rel_err < 1e-7:
        feedback.finish(1, "Your computed c was correct.")
    else:
        feedback.finish(0, "Your computed c was incorrect.")
