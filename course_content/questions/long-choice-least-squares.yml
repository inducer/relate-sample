    # Least squares problems

    Let $m\ge n$ and $\boldsymbol A$ be an $m\times n$ matrix. Which of the
    following conditions suffices to guarantee that
    the least squares system $\boldsymbol A \boldsymbol x\cong \boldsymbol b$
    has a *unique* solution?

choices:

  - Always
  - When $\operatorname{rank}(\boldsymbol A)=m$
  - ~CORRECT~ When $\operatorname{rank}(\boldsymbol A)=n$
  - When $\boldsymbol b$ lies in $\operatorname{span}(\boldsymbol A)$
  - This is a really long option, but *certainly* not the correct one.

    Instead, it tests whether Markdown works in choice questions.
